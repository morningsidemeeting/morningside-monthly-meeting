          Morningside Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends,
          formed in 1973, is a welcoming, diverse community of individuals
          living the Quaker testimonies of equality, integrity, simplicity,
          stewardship of the earth, and peace.

        <p>
          We gather for <Link to="worship">silent worship</Link> every First Day
          (Sunday) morning at 11 oâ€™clock. Traditionally, we meet at Riverside
          Church in Manhattan. Currently we hold hybrid meetings, with some
          members attending via Zoom and others gathering together and
          connecting from Riverside. All are welcome.
