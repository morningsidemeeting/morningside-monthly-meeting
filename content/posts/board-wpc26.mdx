Friends General Conference and the [White Privilege Conference](https://www.theprivilegeinstitute.com/wpc26) have been connected since 2011, when FGC sponsored a group discount for Friends to attend.  In the past, FGC and local Friends have provided a space at the conference for Quaker worship and worship sharing daily. In addition, local Friends have provided overnight hospitality to out-of-state participants, as well as arranged carpools to and from the hotel each day. 

It has been important for Quakers to attend the White Privilege Conference (WPC). Starting with roughly 68 Quakers attending the 2011 retreat, Friends General Conference (FGC) has maintained having roughly 45-500 Quakers attend the conference yearly. After attending the conference, many Quaker attenders uplift in evaluations; the joys WPC gives to connect to people of all ethnicities and ages, the variety of resources given to carry anti-racism forward, and empowerment from the energy that comes from the Conference’s large attendance.

Our Quaker attenders write that from the WPC they bring back new knowledge and energy to the racial justice work of their local Quaker Meeting. Attenders have also highlighted how meaningful it felt for FGC to show its support for anti-oppression work, and that they feel like the White Privilege Conference is a place where they feel empowered by “Quakers coming together in a public ministry around anti-racism.” 

NYYM Black Concerns Committee will be offering financial support, if needed, to NYYM members and attenders - details to follow.
