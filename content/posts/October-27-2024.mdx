Share breakfast with Morningsiders this Sunday in the Riverside Cafe, Riverside Church, at 9:30 am. Just select your breakfast and tell the cashier you are with the Quakers and the meeting picks up the tab. Itâ€™s a lovely time to get to know one another, to ask questions and to get ready for the day. Please join us!
