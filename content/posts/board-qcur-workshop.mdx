Quaker Coalition for Uprooting Racism (QCUR) invites you to participate in a half-day of community organizing to resist the current rise of fascism in the U.S. on Saturday, May 10th, 1-5pm ET via Zoom. We encourage Quaker organizations, schools, committees, and meetings to make themselves hubs so people can gather in person to Zoom together.

This workshop will have time for worship, connecting with each other, and learning how to use power mapping as a tool for resistance and anti-racist change-making. Power-mapping is an interactive, strategic tool for identifying and analyzing where and how power is being held and used around a specific issue. It allows groups to develop effective strategies for leveraging power to make constructive, anti-racist change.

After learning how to use power mapping, there will be time for groups to work together in community, with coaching and support available from QCUR. We will also have a break-out rooms available for those attending solo who want to work with others or for geographically spread out groups. To grow our web and form mutual support, QCUR can connect with groups of Friends working on similar issues after the workshop. 

Friends can [register for the worshop online](https://lu.ma/QCURPower) or call Pendle Hill for more information at 610-566-4507, ext. 137.
