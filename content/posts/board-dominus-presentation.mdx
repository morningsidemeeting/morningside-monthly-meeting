On Sunday, July 20th at 1pm, after the rise of meeting and fellowship, Morningside member Bart Dominus will discuss and give a demonstration of a project he considers his “final testimony and bequest to the future of the Quakers.”  This will be a hybrid in-person/online presentation.  All Friends are warmly welcome to attend.

Bart writes, “My company is building, with God’s help, a web app which will enable all Quakers and their meetings the means to express what being a Quaker means to them personally, easily, succinctly and expressively. The presentation also contains a strategy for distributing this understanding to others widely both inside and outside the Quaker community.”

A complete outline of Bart's presentation is available on the Morningside Meeting website.  [Click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Li-HR_iqIvdGqpFaNKl1m7Vt0c-TB73n/view) to read it.
