The Peace and Social Concerns Committee will hold a called hybrid meeting at 1pm, after meeting for worship, on Sunday, August 24th.  Those who choose to attend will discern whether the committee should recommend that Morningside sign on to the letter "Quakers Discern Genocide is Occurring in Gaza and Urge Courageous Action" published by eight Quaker organizations including FNCL and the AFSC.  Friends can [read the letter here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hwCxH9BMxYhIkRI3WON5z54djDnlvdlg/view?usp=drive_link).  A member of P&SC recommends [Omer Bartov's July 15, 2025 Op-Ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/opinion/israel-gaza-holocaust-genocide-palestinians.html) in the New York Times to those planning to attend.  All are welcome.

Additionally, those attending will consider bringing a minute before our September business meeting urging Governor Houchul to provide fair pathways of release from New York's prisons the wake of this year's wildcat strikes by corrections officers.
