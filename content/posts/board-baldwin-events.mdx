Following the January 26 meeting of the Racial Justice Study and Action Group, Helen Garay Toppins shared information about two upcoming events highlighting the life and work of James Baldwin:

**Turkey Saved My Life - Baldwin in Istanbul, 1961–1971**  
at the BrooklynPublic Library  
December 12, 2024 to March 15, 2025  
Central Library, Grand Lobby  

Celebrating James Baldwin’s centennial, the exhibition Turkey Saved My Life - Baldwin in Istanbul, 1961–1971 captures an exceptionally fertile period for the incomparable Baldwin, defined by his sojourn to a country that would allow him to gain critical distance from, and new perspectives on, America, particularly its poisonous racism and homophobia. Consisting of sweeping photographs by Turkish photographer Sedat Pakay, one of Baldwin’s close friends, the exhibition provides an intimate travelogue portrait of an understudied yet pivotal time in Baldwin’s life.
