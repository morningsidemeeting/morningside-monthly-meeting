Bernard Winter shares this announcement:

Come make a joyful noise March 28 and 29 with gifted singer-songwriter, chant maker and workshop leader Michael Stillwater. Ticket prices have recently been reduced for the ChantWave community song event on Friday, March 28. Michael is a gifted singer songwriter and has written hundreds of beautiful chants that are easy to sing and fun to harmonize with. Gary Malkin has collaborated with Michael on his Graceful Passages project and is a talented pianist and composer in his own right. Come to sing or just to listen!

And for those who want to explore creating their own soul song, Saturday's workshop, Song Sanctuary, will be a wonderful opportunity to explore musical improvisation and expression in a supportive group setting.

Plus there is a generous discount available, whether you're purchasing tickets for ChantWave, Song Sanctuary or both.
