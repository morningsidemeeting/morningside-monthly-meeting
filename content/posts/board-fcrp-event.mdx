Dear Friends,

I have been involved with the Friends Conference on Religion and Psychology for over twenty years. FCRP was founded about 80 years ago to explore how Jungian psychology could benefit our practice of religion.  Each year FCRP hosts a weekend conference with a plenary speaker and interactive interest groups.  

The 46th annual Washington Friends Conference on Religion and Psychology will be held on February 7-9, 2025, online.  We will be hosting Kenneth Kovacs, PhD, Diploma candidate (psychoanalyst-in-training) at the C. G. Jung Institute-Zurich, as our plenary speaker on this topic:

Many religious people say, “We are God’s hands.” Carl Jung wrote much about “self-actualization.” How far apart are these concepts, really? Can we gain from exploring both?

Pioneering psychologist Carl Jung was the son of a minister. And although many are aware of how Jung’s consciousness of many religions grew through his lifetime and were discussed in his writings, few have given attention to his ongoing relationship with Christianity.  Typical of Jung, however, his views took him, and others, into new and deep dimensions.

Ken Kovacs’ explorations on this material have taken him to the Jung archives in Zurich, Switzerland and elsewhere. Jung’s correspondence with ministers gives light to long-term relationships that included personal visits in which they discussed how the church and the field of psychology might overcome the gap between them.
