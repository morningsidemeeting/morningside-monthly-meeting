Morningside Meeting will hold our next virtual **meeting for worship on October 25th at 11 a.m.** The virtual meeting room will be open at 10:45 a.m. for Friends and attenders to begin to gather. Worship will be followed by a period of afterwords, announcements and introductions of all those present. (The link for joining meeting for worship will be sent separately.)

> Friends are reminded that our Religious Society took form in times of
> disturbance, and that its continuing testimony has been the power of God to
> lead men and women out of the confusions of outward violence, inward sickness,
> and all other forms of self-will, however upheld by social convention.
