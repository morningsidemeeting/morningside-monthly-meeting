New York Yearly Meeting shares this news:

A federal judge granted an injunction in response to the lawsuit brought by a several Quaker groups (including New York Yearly Meeting), a Sikh Temple, and a Baptist Fellowship. The lawsuit sought to reverse the recent decision allowing ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) operations to take place inside houses of worship without a warrant. The injunction granted by the judge is narrow, only extending to the specific religious congregations in the lawsuit.

**The monthly meetings in NYYM are now protected from unwarranted ICE actions in or near their worship spaces.** We hope that the Freedom of Religion rights of all faiths will soon be equally respected.
