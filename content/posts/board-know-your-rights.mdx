Friends are concerned about the possibility of Immigration & Customs Enforcement agents (or other authorities) coming to their Meetings in search of undocumented persons. New York Yearly Meeting won a preliminary injunction preserving the “sensitive locations” policy that had severely limited the circumstances under which ICE agents could conduct operations in a church.  NYYM also had to supply the lawyers for the defendants with a list of all our Meetings so ICE can know which places of worship are protected by the preliminary injunction.  

On May 4, 2025, from 7-9 pm, NYYM will hold a virtual program facilitated by Frederick Dettmer (Purchase Meeting) on how to respond if ICE agents or other government authorities come to your Meeting intending to find and arrest undocumented persons. 

What are our rights? Obligations? What should we do to document what is happening?  How can we best secure the Meetinghouse? Learn what to do and what not to do. Get your questions answered.
