**Meeting for Worship**

Morningside Meeting will hold **[meeting for worship](/worship) on December 15 at 11 a.m.: a hybrid in-person/remote meeting for worship,** followed by afterwords, announcements, and introductions of visitors and those new to Morningside. The virtual meeting room will be open at 10:45 a.m. for Friends and attenders to begin to gather. If you are new to Morningside, or not on the email list, and wish to attend, please email: morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.

We welcome children to come to Meeting with Children on the 13th floor on Sundays from 11:00 until shortly before noon. If you have any questions, please email morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.

Join us at 12:45 for worship sharing as we prepare our State of the Meeting report.  The query will be, "How does your Meeting or you, if you are a member at large or an isolated Friend, listen to and respond to spirit in your community?"

Our annual cookie swap will also take place on Sunday. Bring 3 dozen: 1 dozen to swap, 2 dozen to share with the community.

**For those who wish to participate at Morningside worship in person**, please note the following:

- In-person Meeting for Worship will occur at Riverside Church **on the 12th Floor.**
- At this time, masks are welcome but optional for in-person worship.

Morningside Meeting Ministry and Counsel is a committee charged with the pastoral care of the meeting. Members are available to answer questions about Quakerism, about Friends Meeting, and to provide support. To reach the committee, please email: morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.
