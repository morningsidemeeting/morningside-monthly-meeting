On Thursday, February 13, Mayor Adams announced that "he is preparing an executive order to allow U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement officers to operate on Rikers Island" ([Gothamist](https://gothamist.com/news/mayor-adams-plans-executive-order-allowing-ice-presence-at-rikers-island)).  This "significant shift in the city’s sanctuary policies" would allow agents to "assist in criminal investigations, 'in particular those focused on violent criminals and gangs'" ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/adams-ice-rikers-homan.html)).

Meanwhile, [Governor Hochul has proposed](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-proposals-combat-crime-and-strengthen-criminal-justice-system) to "streamline the discovery process…by amending reforms passed in 2019."  [The Alliance to Protect Kalief's Law](https://protectkaliefslaw.com/) is strongly opposed to this proposal, claiming that it will lead "to more wrongful convictions, coerced plea deals, and clogged courts."  Concerned Friends can learn more about the [2019 discovery reforms](https://indefenseof.us/issues/blindfolded), the law's namesake, [Kalief Browder](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/06/before-the-law), [join the coalition](https://protectkaliefslaw.com/stayinformed) and get other information on the alliance's [website](https://protectkaliefslaw.com/).
