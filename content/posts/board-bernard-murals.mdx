Hi Friends, some joyous news to share. I will be giving a tour of the completed murals at the school I retired from, The Manhattan School for Children, PS 333 on Monday, June 2nd, as part of our school-wide Arts Festival. These murals were begun in 2023 and finished this year with the help of parents, children and faculty. You are welcome to join me as I give the tour and explain the history and the process.
