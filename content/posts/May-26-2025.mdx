**Meeting for Worship**

Morningside Meeting will hold **[meeting for worship](/worship) on May 25 at 11 a.m.: a hybrid in-person/remote meeting for worship,** followed by afterwords, announcements, and introductions of visitors and those new to Morningside. The virtual meeting room will be open at 10:45 a.m. for Friends and attenders to begin to gather. If you are new to Morningside, or not on the email list, and wish to attend, please email: morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.

We welcome children to come to Meeting with Children on the 13th floor on Sundays from 11:00 until shortly before noon. If you have any questions, please email morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.

Those who wish to participate at Morningside worship in person, please note the following:

- In-person Meeting for Worship will occur at Riverside Church **on the 12th Floor.**
- At this time, masks are welcome but optional for in-person worship.

**Additional Meetings**

Dan Seeger will be our guest speaker at Morningside’s **Racial Justice Study & Action Group** hybrid meeting at 1:00 PM. He will share an account of his spiritual journey leading to the Supreme Court case of United States versus Daniel A. Seeger (1965).  He will then turn to contemporary affairs, particularly the matter of the economic implications of “the war on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion" (DEI) being carried out by the current administration. This will be followed by Q&A w/ an open discussion.

**Breakfast**

Share breakfast with Morningsiders every Sunday in the Riverside Cafe, on the 1st floor of Riverside Church, at 9:30 am. It's a lovely time to get to know one another, to ask questions and to get ready for worship. This is the 4th Sunday of the month, so breakfast is free for all who wish to join us!  Just get your breakfast and tell the cashier you are with the Quakers.

**Ministry and Counsel**

Morningside Meeting Ministry and Counsel is a committee charged with the pastoral care of the meeting. Members are available to answer questions about Quakerism, about Friends Meeting, and to provide support. To reach the committee, please email: morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.
