**Additional Meetings**

The **Peace & Social Concerns Committee** will meet at 1 pm to discuss two topics: whether Morningside should endorse of the document from eight worldwide Quaker organizations: “Quakers Discern Genocide is Occurring in Gaza”; a minute to a minute to Governor Hochul on releasing people who are incarcerated, particularly the elderly, given the deteriorating conditions in state prisons.

**Breakfast**

Share breakfast with Morningsiders every Sunday in the Riverside Cafe, on the 1st floor of Riverside Church, at 9:30 am. It's a lovely time to get to know one another, to ask questions and to get ready for worship. This is the 4th Sunday of the month, so breakfast is free for all who wish to join us!  Just get your breakfast and tell the cashier you are with the Quakers.

**Ministry and Counsel**
