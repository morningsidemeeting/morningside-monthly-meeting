Bernard Winter shares this announcement:

Hello Morningside Friends, 

I am writing to let you know that my wife, Sandra Winter, is organizing a very special weekend, March 28th-30th and I hope you will be available to join us for all or part of the weekend. 

For the last several years, Sandra has been studying with singer-songwriter, filmmaker and transformational teacher Michael Stillwater. Michael's interfaith chants and healing songs are enjoyed worldwide in singing circles, gatherings, churches and communities. 

Now Michael will be coming to New York City at the end of March and facilitating a weekend featuring a 'Chant Wave' evening of spiritual chants and a half-day Song Sanctuary, an experiential workshop on musical healing and creativity. Michael will also be the guest speaker at Unity of New York on Sunday, March 30, and will be offering an Honoring Ceremony after the service, which will be happening from 2-4:30PM.

All events will be happening at St. Michael's Church, 225 West 99th Street in Manhattan.

I hope you can join us for one or all the heart-opening events in March.

Peace,  
Bernard Winter
