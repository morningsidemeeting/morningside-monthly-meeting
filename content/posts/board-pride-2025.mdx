Friends have participated in the [NYC Pride March](https://www.nycpride.org/event/nyc-pride-march) every year since its beginning, and were the very first religious group to march.  All are welcome to march with us again on June 29, 2025. Read more about NYC Quakers and LGBTQIA+ Pride at [https://nycquakers.org/pride](https://nycquakers.org/pride).
